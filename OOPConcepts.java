		 * Four Pillars of OOP:
		 * 1. Abstraction
		 * Triangle
		 * Table - we know what it is but not all specifics about it - essential features of an entity we know about
		 * 2. Encapsulation
		 * Driving a car - we know how to drive a car but we don't need to know about what's under the hood to drive a car
		 * 3. Inheritance
		 * Allows objects or classes to inherit from parent classes
		 * 4. Polymorphism
		 * Animals communicate in different ways - Something that can take many forms
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Class - how we structure our code in OOP
		 * Class is like blueprint
		 * Object is the actual product developed from the blueprint
		 * An Object is an Instance of a class
